<p>I am a <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/masters/dfi/msc-design-for-interaction" target="_blank">Design for Interaction</a> student at the Industrial Design Engineering faculty of Delft University of Technology, the Netherlands.

    During my design projects, I have found myself most at home in <strong>interaction design</strong>, system design, and <em>aesthetics</em>. I am also interested in sustainability, having dedicated my Minor to this.
    Through my work, I have found that the why behind a design is important to me, as well as making things accessible and intuitive. I value and pursue simplicity and meaning.</p>
